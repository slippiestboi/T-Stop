<p>Founded in 1986 by our founder Johnathan "Jonno" Johnson II, John Johnson was committed to opening his own retail store in order to provide for his family. John Johnson senior had been convicted for multiple crimes, causing him to be absent for most of John's life. John's wife had now been left to tend to five children all by herself. John II, being the eldest child at 15, decided to help his mother in raising the rest of the family. Jonno opened the first T-Stop in Virginia, deciding he would pursue in the fashion industry. With his creativity John II created his own t-shirts representing things that he associated himself with. This proved to be a good business, being able to open two other locations in 1988. From 1989 onward, T-Stop has been expanding it's variety in t-shirts. Because of John Johnson II's contributions we have been able to keep the business up and running for the past, present, and onward towards the future!</p>
